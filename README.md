# jestlearn
## serverless website for interactive educational content
Make multichoice/input problems with ease!

## How to use:
Edit `data.ts` with problem sets and such and that's mostly it

## Todo:
* Anki spaced alg.
* consider removing choice problem because all select problems are choice problems, but not all choice problems are select ones, maybe there's a way to limit the checkbox selection
* pure offline support
* Add more documentation, make it easier to set up a sync server, a video to show how to set it up
* GUI editor for problems? (too lazy atm, just edit js)
* Analytics page for teachers

## Motivation:
I just want something super simple, fast, flexible(open source), and offline to make small educational exercise content. Google classroom and everything else is too bloat, not to mention I don't really care about grades. Instead of focusing on grades, focus on constant repitition, ergo Anki, because memory is fragile.
